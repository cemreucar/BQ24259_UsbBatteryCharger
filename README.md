BQ24259 I2C Controlled2A Single Cell USB Charger

In this project, I drew a BQ24259 Battery Charger using Altium Designer.
Description 
The bq24259is a highly-integrated switch-mode battery charge management and system power path management device for 1 cell Li-Ion and Li-polymer batteryin a wide range of smartphone and tablet applications.Its low impedance power path optimizes switch-mode operation efficiency,reduces battery charging time and extends battery life during discharging phase.The I2C serial interface with charging and system settings makes the device a truly flexible solution.
